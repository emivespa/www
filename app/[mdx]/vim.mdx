## vim as MANPAGER

```
# ~/.profile
export MANPAGER="vim -R --not-a-term -c'runtime plugin/manpager.vim | MANPAGER' -"
if command -v 'nvim' >/dev/null 2>&1; then
	export MANPAGER="nvim -c'runtime plugin/man.lua | Man!' -"
fi
```

explained:

```
#                    v Read only mode.
#                    v  v prevent "Reading from stdin...". (Not available/necessary in nvim.)
#                    v  v            v Make sure the plugin is loaded, just in case.
export MANPAGER="vim -R --not-a-term -c'runtime plugin/manpager.vim | MANPAGER' -"
```

## vimpager

The script at
`/usr/share/vim/vim82/macros/less.sh`
(where 82 might be whatever version)
is way too complex,
this does the same thing:

```
if test -t 1; then
	vi -c 'set nomodifiable readonly' "${@:--}"
else
	cat "${@:--}"
fi
```

## poor man's vimanywhere

Every once in a while a "vimanywhere" comes out: a tool to have vim in
any input. They're usually somewhat hacky and a pain to set up, but with
`vipe`, you can pipe clipboard contents through your editor, that's:

```
xsel -bo | vipe | xsel -bi  # for Linux.
pbpaste | vipe | pbcopy     # for Mac (probably).
```
