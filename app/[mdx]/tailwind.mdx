## auto class sorting is a must

Class sorting bugs are of the "silently does the wrong thing" variety.
There are 2 strategies you can use to prevent them:

- running a function to merge classes
  ```
  className={mergeFunc("some classes", "more classes")}
  ```
- (your tools) ordering classes the right way

Here's how you set up class auto sorting
(more info on [the Tailwind blog post][tba] and [Theo's video][yQ]).

This assumes you've performed a default install,
either by using something like `create-next-app`
or installing it as per [the docs][tdi].

You install `prettier` first
(you likely have `eslint` set up,
so that means [`eslint-config-prettier`][gpe]).
Then `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` as per its [README][gtp].
