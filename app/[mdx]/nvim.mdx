# nvim config shouldn't be hard

## Use full links (on any package manager)

Not sure where it started,
but most package managers have an "implicit Github" feature where `ghost/plugin` get's converted to `https:/github.com/ghost/plugin`.
Don't use it - that way you can `gx` over the link them to go straight to the docs.

## Don't inline lazy.vim dependencies

Like this:

```
{
  'https://github.com/ghost/dependent',
  dependencies = {
    {
      'https://github.com/ghost/dependency',
    }
  },
}
```

Seems simple enough,
but as soon as those plugins have any config,
it can turn into a mess pretty quickly.
Instead, name them:

```
{
  'https://github.com/ghost/dependent',
  dependencies = { 'dependency', },
},
{
  'https://github.com/ghost/dependency',
  name = 'dependency',
},
```

The one gotcha:
if you change the URL but not the name,
(say, if you switch a plugin for a fork of it)
Lazy won't clone the new one by default.
You open `:Lazy` and press `X` on the plugin to clean it,
then restart nvim.
