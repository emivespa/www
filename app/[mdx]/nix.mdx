## NixOS: Everything you know is strictly forbidden

You can't `npm i -g` stuff on NixOS.
([wiki entry](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Node.js#Using_npm_install_-g_fails)).

You can't just clone a project and `sudo make install` to a global prefix like some animal.

You can't use most ways of installing stuff globally.
`/usr/bin/` is read-only.

> if you want to setup a global development environment without using ephemeral
> shells, the canonical nixos way to do that is "just don't"

## You don't actually need NixOS

You can get a lot of the benefits of the Nix package manager while still being
able to copy/paste install commands from Github by foregoing NixOS and just
using Nix with a non-immutable distro like Ubuntu or Fedora.

## Enough nix to be dangerous

Ok, so you know not to dive head first into NixOS until you're somewhat confortable with Nix.
How far should you go before you make the switch?
You should be able to build and install a binary that has at least one non-packaged dependency.

### NixOS survival guide

[ðŸ’» NixOS ain't worth it](https://port19.xyz/tech/nixos/):

> If you google an issue, the solutions you find will likely not apply.
>
> Worse, the knowledge and skill you gain will not cary over to more traditional distros like debian or arch.
>
> Nix os vs arch is more like openbsd vs arch rather than debian vs arch.
>
> Sure, the kernel is still linux, but the whole system will feel unfamiliar.
>
> Ask yourself, is reproducibility via configuration.nix worth it?
>
> Or would you rather maintain your dotfiles and a package list?
>
> Do you always need more or is arch + aur enough software?
>
> Are rollbacks important to you and do you also have beef with the timeshift maintainer?
>
> If you're unsure, stay away from nix os.

> **Hey,** you. You're finally awake. You were trying to configure your OS
> declaratively, right? Walked right into that NixOS ambush, same as us,
> and those dotfiles over there.

## devShell all the things

Dev shells obviate version managers as a category, so no need to use
`nvm` (or `fnm`) for Node,
`tfenv` for Terraform,
`gvm` for go,
and so on.
(You can think of your nix as the version manager to rule them all, I guess.)

Heres a simple flake with just a devshell:

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  description = "";
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable";
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
  };
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let
        pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; };
        packages = with pkgs; [ figlet ];
      in {
        devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
          packages = packages;
          shellHook = "echo 'entering dev shell'";
        };
      });
}
```

You can use `nix develop` to run it, but you want to make it automatic with direnv:

```
echo 'use flake' >>./.envrc
```

### Have your Dockerfile match your flake exactly

## You probably don't need home-manager either

Can be tempting since everyone tells you to use it but I'd advice against it.
