## NixOS

### npm install --global is strictly forbidden

https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Node.js#Using_npm_install_-g_fails

This applies to a lot of things.
You can't even clone a C project and `make install`.

> if you want to setup a global development environment without using ephemeral
> shells, the canonical nixos way to do that is "just don't"

### You don't need NixOS

You can get a lot of the benefits of the Nix package manager while still being
able to copy/paste install commands from Github by foregoing NixOS and just
using Nix with a non-immutable distro like Ubuntu or Fedora.
