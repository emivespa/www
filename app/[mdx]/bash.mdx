## The porcelain-plumbing pattern

For longer scripts it's very practical to emulate the structure of the
`git` CLI. Make every function a subcommand you can call regardless of
whether it's a user-facing "porcelain" ones or an internal "plumbing"
ones:

```bash
#!/bin/sh -eu
helper() { printf %s\\n 'This is an internal "plumbing" command.'; return 0; }
subcommand_1() { helper && printf %s\\n 'This is a user-facing "porcelain" command' ; }
subcommand_2() { helper && printf %s\\n 'This is a user-facing "porcelain" command' ; }

main() {
	1>&2 printf %s\\n "usage:"
	1>&2 printf %s\\n "	scriptx subcommand_1"
	1>&2 printf %s\\n "	scriptx subcommand_2"
	exit 1
}

# [flag parsing]
# [anything that MUST run every time]

"${1:-main}" # Calls a subcommand or main if there isn't one.
```

This is great for testing because you can call every function on it's
own by running `scriptx helper`, `scriptx subcommand_1`.

## Scripts run on yolo mode by default

Use ["bash strict mode"][rau],
in `bash` that's `set -euo pipefail` at the top of your script.
in `sh` there's no `-o pipefail` but you can use `#!/bin/sh -eu`.

[rau]: http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/

That blog post is OK,
but it does not tell you how to get around `-e` and `-u`.
And it's not so rare that you have to.

For `-e` if a command is fail-safe,
you can let it fail by catching it within an "if" or OR-ing it with `true`
(a builtin that does nothing except succeed).

```
if might_fail; then
fi
might_fail_as_well || true
```

For `-u` use parameter expansion.

```
echo "${if_this_variable_doesnt_exist:-'print this instead'}"
```

> But why do scripts run on YOLO mode exactly?

They run pretty much like your regular bash session runs.
If you `set -e` on an interactive bash shell,
it would get killed as soon as a command failed.

## check for dependences

```
command -v "$dep" >/dev/null 2>&1 || exit 1
```

You can also use `which`, but `command -v` is more portable.

If there's more than one command you can use
(like curl/wget, vim/nvim or something like that)

```
command -v "$either" "$or"
```

will zero if at least one is available,
and you can use this to asign the first available command to a variable:

```
cmd="$(command -v curl || command -v wget)" || exit 1
```

## Parse argv

```bash
while [ "$#" -gt 0 ]; do
	case "$1" in
		(-v|--version) VERSION="$2"; shift 2;;
		(-p|--platform) PLATFORM="$2"; shift 2;;
		(-P|--prefix) PREFIX="$2"; shift 2;;
		(-a|--arch) ARCH="$2"; shift 2;;

		(-V|--verbose) VERBOSE=1; shift 1;;
		(-f|-y|--force|--yes) FORCE=1; shift 1;;

		(-v=*|--version=*) VERSION="${1#*=}"; shift 1;;
		(-p=*|--platform=*) PLATFORM="${1#*=}"; shift 1;;
		(-P=*|--prefix=*) PREFIX="${1#*=}"; shift 1;;
		(-a=*|--arch=*) ARCH="${1#*=}"; shift 1;;
		(-V=*|--verbose=*) VERBOSE="${1#*=}"; shift 1;;
		(-f=*|-y=*|--force=*|--yes=*) FORCE="${1#*=}"; shift 1;;

		(-*) error "Unknown option: $1"; exit 2;;
		(*) VERSION="$1"; shift 1;;
	esac
done
```
