Every new Docker user asks the same thing.
_"Do I really need to use sudo all the time?"_
No, you don't, no one does that, but you wouldn't know it without having to ask.
_It's not in the install docs, it's in the "post install" docs._

There's a broader problem with incomplete how-tos making people run into traps.
This post is about the stuff the docs don't tell you.
(Or maybe they do, but you didn't read it.)
I'll try to be succinct,
which means linking to docs a lot.

## make + .env

Use this snippet ([source][r202]) to create make variables out of `.env` values:

[r202]: https://www.robg3d.com/2020/05/2288/

```
ifneq (,$(wildcard ./.env))
	include .env
	export
endif

.PHONY: ping
	ping $(HOST)
```
