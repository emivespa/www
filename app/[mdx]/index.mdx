Random notes converted to blog post placeholders.

- [helloworld   ](/helloworld) - how this website is built

## projects

- [fullfatsearch  ](https://fullfatsearch.vercel.app) - search engine for my favorite podcast
- [iih  ](https://github.com) - IRC client
	- React in the terminal baby - Ink is awesome
	- suckless `ii` backend
		- my initial idea was running this on a RaspberryPi where I just
		  keep `ii` running forever
		- for now, works pretty well as a super simple IRC client
