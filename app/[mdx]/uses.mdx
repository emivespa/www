# /uses

Random stuff I use, will probably write a page for each.

## fzf

I was hesitant to use it at first but now I don't thing I could live without it.

## Ubuntu

I like normie Linux.
Eventually I'll try desktop Alpine and NixOS.

## xterm

Just the fastest terminal.
I like the low input lag
and it's fast enought to use as a program launcher
(think `dmenu` replacement).

## vim (nvim)

I'm currently switching from "tpope standard" Vim to a Neovim setup with all the bells and whistles.

See [/vim](/vim).

## vim's netrw

I tried `ranger`, `lf` and even `shfm` but `netrw`'s tree view is much nicer. There's less context-switching.

These are more file-browsers that file-managers.
Doing anything more complex than a delete or a rename feels "dirty".

## "alt" utils

* `entr`
  * `onchange` - https://www.npmjs.com/package/onchange
* moreutils:
  * `vipe` - `cmd1 | vipe | cmd2`
  * `vidir` - like `roamer` but good
* `tldr`

## manpages-posix

It's not about making sure everything is portable.
The POSIX manpages are just nicer to read.

Your package manager probably has packages called
`manpages-posix` (section 1posix) and
`manpages-posix-dev` (sections 3posix and 7posix).
You can also get them from
[kernel.org](https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/man-pages/man-pages-posix/)
(as sections 1p, 3p and 7p).

Here's how you make them the default:
```diff
# Ubuntu defaults:
export MANSECT='1:n:l:8:3:0:2:3posix:3pm:3perl:3am:5:4:9:6:7'
# Same but Nposix before N:
export MANSECT='1posix:1:n:l:8:3posix:3:0:2:3pm:3perl:3am:5:4:9:6:7posix:7'
```
